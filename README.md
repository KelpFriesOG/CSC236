# CSC236

## Resources and Syllabus

The textbook used for notes and exercises in each chapter is:
**Object Oriented Data Structures Using Java (4th Edition) published by Jones and Bartlett Learning and co-authored by Nell Dale, Daniel T. Joyce, and Chip Weems.**

The contents covered in each chapter is made apparent in the textbook, but generally each chapter is expected to be covered weekly or biweekly in a sequential manner.

## Why is Data Sturctures important?

Data structures is a subject covered by the second or third year of most BA or BS Computer Science degrees. It is usually one of if not the most difficult course for students to push through in their academic career. Understanding structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees may not be the most important concepts when working in most fulltime CS positions, **but their concepts offer students the ability to analyze and understand the mechanics behind complex databases and algorithms behind various applications such as Google's insanely fast search engine**. **Unlike previous courses that teach you core modern programming concepts, this course naturally branches into more complex CS topics and opens up students to the sheer variety and complexity in the world of CS.**

If you want to be a programmer and program applications based on requirements, **this course may seem like a waste of time but is still essential for getting into positions based on job interview questions that frequently come back to core data sturcture concepts and different algorithms.** Practicing coding by learning new concepts is also never a bad idea, even if you decide that those particular skills are not particularly your strong suit, its always good to have them on your resume and as backup if you need them.

If you want to make and design your own application, then this course is **crucial to digest because you may have to end up writing your own structures and algorithms when modelling and implementing your own applications**. Choosing what structure to use depending on the use case will be up to you as the engineer of codebase and while StackOverflow may give you a few ideas, applying your own judgement on those ideas requires a thorough understanding of data structures.

## Why choose Java as opposed to C#, Carbon, Python or other alternatives?

Java is simply the language I chose because my prior classes used it. However the important part is the structures themselves, not what language you code them in. I suggest mastering one language over a few years while learning these concepts. Then, picking up a new language or skill is not as daunting once you know programming concepts that go into any modern language.

- For people planning to major in a field tangential to computer science but not neccesarily fully involved in coding, I would suggest using Python due to its simplistic syntax and versatility.
- For people who want to get the raw experience of quick, backend languages that are ubiquitous in legacy companies I would suggest trying our C# or C++ and maybe even Carbon (although I don't know much about the latter).
- For people looking to get a visible and customizable result from their code I reccomend using "front-end" languages like Javascript. Even though we call them front-end, these languages are so much more versatile than they once were!

I chose Java because it offers a good balance of being both annoying enough to the point where it forces you to develop best practices for your code, while also remaining abstract enough to easily support many use cases outside of boring programming tasks without being overwhelming for new developers. For example you could utilize libraries to visualize these algorithms or structures, use built in libraries to draw images such as fractals that utilize recursion, and so much more!

## What if this seems to daunting to pick up?

- Get help! Don't ever consider yourself less than another developer for not understanding a concept that seems apparently simple.
- Programming is a muscle that builds with practice, but that does not mean you have to force yourself to learn at an uncomfortable pace. If you work another job or are taking care of family, just devote an hour a day to practice when you can and it will do wonders. Don't fuss over the notes and just take it nice and slow!
- There are so many resources for you to use, heck with ChatGPT you can just ask for a template of code or ask it to explain concepts. Really makes me question why I am doing this to be honest... Just kidding!
- No matter how many answers you read online, your job interview will be one on one with no room for excuses. Its one thing to learn from online resources and another thing to pick up skills through a textbook. Sometimes the analog way of taking notes is best and other times simply listening to the text will suffice, it all depends on your mood and preference!

If you get tired, bored, or otherwise burnt out, just remember that you can quite literally code **anything** your heart desires with a little googling and patience. Make something for yourself or for someone else, learn by creating code you actually find useful and try out anything that sparks your interest no matter how simple, goofy, or irrelevant it might seem.

- After all you want to be able to code for your own happiness and self satisfaction, not just to fulfill your employeers. If not that, then what the hell is even the point?

Good luck and happy coding! Feel free to raise issues if anything I have is incorrect or if you have specific questions.
